# Title: Disk Space Usage Reporter
# Description: Displays total, used, available disk space, and usage percentage 
#              for the root file system in a human-readable format.

# --- Core Command: df -h ---
# df: report file system disk space usage.
# -h: human-readable format (e.g., 100G instead of bytes).

echo -e "\n--- System Disk Usage Report ---"
echo "Target: Root File System (/)"

# Use df -h to get the data, then awk to filter and format.
# 1. df -h output is piped.
# 2. grep '^/' filters for lines starting with / (usually the main file systems).
# 3. awk '{print $2, $3, $4, $5}' selects the specific columns: 
#    $2 = Size (Total)
#    $3 = Used
#    $4 = Avail (Available)
#    $5 = Use% (Usage Percentage)

# Header
echo -e "\n-----------------------------------------------------"
printf "%-10s %-10s %-10s %-10s\n" "TOTAL" "USED" "AVAILABLE" "USAGE %"
echo "-----------------------------------------------------"

# Data extraction
df -h | grep ' /$' | awk '{printf "%-10s %-10s %-10s %-10s\n", $2, $3, $4, $5}'

echo -e "-----------------------------------------------------\n"

# Optional: Add a conclusion based on usage
USAGE_PERCENT=$(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')
